Multiple - Linear Analysis and Random Forest Regresion analysis were done on wave data.

This dataset contains Measured/Calculated wave parameters.
Measured and derived wave data from data collected by oceanographic wave measuring buoys anchored at Mooloolaba.
Coverage period: 30 months.

Train-Test Split Ratio = 0.8 , 0.2.

For both analysis;
	independent variables: Tz, Tp, Peak Direction, SST
	dependent variables: Hs, Hmax

Multiple Linear Regression's Results and Random Forest Regression's Results were compared each other.

R^2 method and data visualization were used.
