Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Concrete Mix and comparison of test data and predicted values.

R^2 method and data visualization were used.

OLS model were used for backward elemination.

Train-Test Split Ratio = 0.8 , 0.2.

Independent Variables = Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, Age
Dependent Variable = Concrete compressive strength
